 * Patch resources are used to modify existing Kubernetes resources by using

 * one patch may be applied to the same resource, and a random FieldManager name will be used for each Patch resource.
 * Conflicts will result in an error by default, but can be forced using the "pulumi.com/patchForce" annotation. See the
 * [Server-Side Apply Docs](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/kubernetes/how-to-guides/managing-resources-with-server-side-apply/) for
 * additional information about using Server-Side Apply to manage Kubernetes resources with Pulumi.
 * The TLSRoute resource is similar to TCPRoute, but can be configured
 * to match against TLS-specific metadata. This allows more flexibility
 * in matching streams for a given TLS listener.
 *
 * If you need to forward traffic to a single target for a TLS listener, you
 * could choose to use a TCPRoute with a TLS listener.
