/**
 * XListenerSet defines a set of additional listeners to attach to an existing Gateway.
 * This resource provides a mechanism to merge multiple listeners into a single Gateway.
 *
 * The parent Gateway must explicitly allow ListenerSet attachment through its
 * AllowedListeners configuration. By default, Gateways do not allow ListenerSet
 * attachment.
 *
 * Routes can attach to a ListenerSet by specifying it as a parentRef, and can
 * optionally target specific listeners using the sectionName field.
 *
 * Policy Attachment:
 * - Policies that attach to a ListenerSet apply to all listeners defined in that resource
 * - Policies do not impact listeners in the parent Gateway
 * - Different ListenerSets attached to the same Gateway can have different policies
 * - If an implementation cannot apply a policy to specific listeners, it should reject the policy
 *
 * ReferenceGrant Semantics:
 * - ReferenceGrants applied to a Gateway are not inherited by child ListenerSets
 * - ReferenceGrants applied to a ListenerSet do not grant permission to the parent Gateway's listeners
 * - A ListenerSet can reference secrets/backends in its own namespace without a ReferenceGrant
 *
 * Gateway Integration:
 * - The parent Gateway's status will include an "AttachedListenerSets" condition
 * - This condition will be:
 *   - True: when AllowedListeners is set and at least one child ListenerSet is attached
 *   - False: when AllowedListeners is set but no valid listeners are attached, or when AllowedListeners is not set or false
 *   - Unknown: when no AllowedListeners config is present
