         * PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an

         * in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
         * Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and

         * SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
         * have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
         *
         * In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
         * resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
         * targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
         *

         * Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
         * implementations.

         * For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
         * used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
         * In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
         * ancestor object referred to in this status.

             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the

             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
             * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly

             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef

             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be

             *
             * ## Distinct Listeners
             *
             * Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
             * MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to

             * "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
             * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
             * apply in that case).
             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
             * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
             * they support:
             *
             * HTTPRoute
             *
             * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
             * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
             *
             * TLSRoute
             *
             * 1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough
             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener**.
             *
             * When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
             * each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
             * values for other fields.
             *
             * The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
             * The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
             * Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
             * Gateway API spec.
             *
             * The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
             * values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:
             *
             * * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
             * * **TCP, UDP**: Port
             *
             * One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
             * implementation:
             *
             * * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
             *   Listeners, and
             * * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
             *   Protocol.
             *
             * In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
             * TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.
             *
             * If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
             * previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
             * accepted.
             *
             * Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
             * Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.
             *
             * ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             *
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * ## Handling indistinct Listeners
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
             * purpose of this documentation.
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners.
             *
             * Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
             * the following rules:
             *
             * * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
             *   ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
             * * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
             *   contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * ## General Listener behavior
             *
             * Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
             * For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             *
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
             * of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
             * clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
             * `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.
             *
             * Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
             * for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
             * conformance tests.
             *
             * ## Compatible Listeners
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.
             *
             * In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.
             *
             * Support: Core

             *
             * ## Distinct Listeners
             *
             * Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
             * MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to

             * "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
             * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
             * apply in that case).
             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
             * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
             * they support:
             *
             * HTTPRoute
             *
             * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
             * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
             *
             * TLSRoute
             *
             * 1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough
             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener**.
             *
             * When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
             * each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
             * values for other fields.
             *
             * The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
             * The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
             * Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
             * Gateway API spec.
             *
             * The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
             * values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:
             *
             * * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
             * * **TCP, UDP**: Port
             *
             * One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
             * implementation:
             *
             * * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
             *   Listeners, and
             * * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
             *   Protocol.
             *
             * In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
             * TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.
             *
             * If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
             * previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
             * accepted.
             *
             * Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
             * Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.
             *
             * ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             *
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * ## Handling indistinct Listeners
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
             * purpose of this documentation.
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners.
             *
             * Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
             * the following rules:
             *
             * * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
             *   ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
             * * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
             *   contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * ## General Listener behavior
             *
             * Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
             * For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             *
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
             * of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
             * clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
             * `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.
             *
             * Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
             * for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
             * conformance tests.
             *
             * ## Compatible Listeners
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.
             *
             * In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

             *   not match.

             * as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
             * both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
             *

             * If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
             * match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The

             * `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
             *

             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
             * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is

             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
             *
             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
             * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
             * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
             * Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
             * generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
             *

             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef

             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *

             *   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters

             * Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
             * extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

             * choose how that 50 percent is determined.

             * When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready endpoints,

             * If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above rules for 500 responses

             * that behavior.
             *

             * a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
             * "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.
             *
             * Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:
             *
             * - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
             * - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
             * - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
             *   implementations.
             *
             * Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
             * indicated in the filter.

             * All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
             * URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
             * implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly

             * * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by

             * ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
             * to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
             * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
             * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
             * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
             *
             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
             * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
             * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
             * Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
             * generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
             *

             * ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
             * to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
             * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
             * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
             * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
             *
             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
             * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
             * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
             * Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
             * generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
             *
             *
             * ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
             * routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
             * any namespace to the Service.
             *
             * ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
             * "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
             * connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
             * the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a

             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the

             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.

             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific

             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the

             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,

             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific

             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef

             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *

             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef

             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.

             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may

             * which to namespace this status.
             *
             * Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
             * the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
             * use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
             * that they are responsible for.
             *
             * Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
             * MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
             * and ControllerName fields combined.
             *
             * A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
             * means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.
             *
             * If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
             * Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
             * on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
             * here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
             * additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by

         * PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
         * associated Ancestor.
         *
         * Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
         * in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
         * Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
         * the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
         * useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
         * SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
         * have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
         *
         * In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
         * resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
         * targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
         *
         * Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
         * ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
         * Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
         * implementations.
         *
         * For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
         * used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
         * In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
         * ancestor object referred to in this status.
         *
         * Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
         * relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.
         *
         * This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
         * with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

         * PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
         * associated Ancestor.
         *
         * Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
         * in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
         * Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
         * the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
         * useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
         * SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
         * have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
         *
         * In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
         * resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
         * targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
         *
         * Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
         * ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
         * Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
         * implementations.
         *
         * For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
         * used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
         * In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
         * ancestor object referred to in this status.
         *
         * Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
         * relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.
         *
         * This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,

             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support

             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the

             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.

             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.

             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef

             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.

             *
             * ## Distinct Listeners
             *
             * Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
             * MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
             * exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
             * "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
             * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
             * apply in that case).
             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
             * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
             * they support:
             *
             * HTTPRoute
             *
             * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
             * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
             *
             * TLSRoute
             *
             * 1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough
             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener**.
             *
             * When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
             * each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
             * values for other fields.
             *
             * The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
             * The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
             * Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
             * Gateway API spec.
             *
             * The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
             * values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:
             *
             * * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
             * * **TCP, UDP**: Port
             *
             * One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
             * implementation:
             *
             * * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
             *   Listeners, and
             * * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
             *   Protocol.
             *
             * In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
             * TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.
             *
             * If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
             * previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
             * accepted.
             *
             * Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
             * Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.
             *
             * ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             *
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * ## Handling indistinct Listeners
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
             * purpose of this documentation.
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners.
             *
             * Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
             * the following rules:
             *
             * * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
             *   ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
             * * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
             *   contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * ## General Listener behavior
             *
             * Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
             * For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             *
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
             * of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
             * clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
             * `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.
             *
             * Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
             * for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
             * conformance tests.
             *
             * ## Compatible Listeners
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.
             *
             * In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

             *
             * ## Distinct Listeners
             *
             * Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
             * MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to

             * "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
             * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
             * apply in that case).
             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
             * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
             * they support:
             *
             * HTTPRoute
             *
             * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
             * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
             *
             * TLSRoute
             *
             * 1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough
             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener**.
             *
             * When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
             * each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
             * values for other fields.
             *
             * The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
             * The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
             * Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
             * Gateway API spec.
             *
             * The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
             * values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:
             *
             * * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
             * * **TCP, UDP**: Port
             *
             * One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
             * implementation:
             *
             * * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
             *   Listeners, and
             * * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
             *   Protocol.
             *
             * In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
             * TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.
             *
             * If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
             * previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
             * accepted.
             *
             * Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
             * Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.
             *
             * ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             *
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * ## Handling indistinct Listeners
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
             * purpose of this documentation.
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners.
             *
             * Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
             * the following rules:
             *
             * * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
             *   ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
             * * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
             *   contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * ## General Listener behavior
             *
             * Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
             * For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             *
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
             * of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
             * clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
             * `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.
             *
             * Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
             * for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
             * conformance tests.
             *
             * ## Compatible Listeners
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.
             *
             * In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

             * as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
             * both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
             *

             * `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.

             * If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
             * match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The

             * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
             * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is

             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
             *
             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
             * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
             * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,

             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.

             * - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by

             *   implementations must support core filters.

             * - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
             *   "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
             *   are encouraged to support extended filters.
             *
             * - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
             *   specific vendors.
             *   In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
             *   implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
             *   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
             *   is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
             *   "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
             *
             * Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
             * extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
             *
             * If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
             * MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
             * that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

             * must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

             *   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters

             * Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
             * extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

             * - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
             * - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
             *   implementations.
             *
             * Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
             * indicated in the filter.
             *
             * All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
             * URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
             * implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
             * document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
             * filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status

             *
             * * "Exact" path match.
             * * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.

             *
             * Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.
             *
             * If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
             * determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:
             *
             * * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
             * * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
             *   "{namespace}/{name}".
             *
